/**
 * This enumeration is used to keep track of where a player currently is within the login --> join --> play --> leave cycle.
 * Bukkit does not provide this information so we forge it as well as we can by listening to LOWEST on a few different events.
 * 
 * When is this information useful?
 * For example you may want to handle events differently depending on whether the player actually is online yet.
 * Say you want to store last teleport position by logging it on the player teleport event.
 * During the login and join phase the server teleports the player around to get the player in position.
 * So for such a "last tp position" system you may want to ignore any teleports other than during player state JOINED.
 * 
 * EngineMassiveCorePlayerState takes care of updating the information.
